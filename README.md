## About
PKX-IconGen is an application made to help in the creation and rendering of Pokemon icons found in the GameCube and Wii Pokemon games.

PKX-IconGen comes with a Blender addon to help you change your icons so only minimal Blender knowledge is required. Knowing how to move in a viewport is the only thing you need to know.

The addon is the main way of changing your icons and manually changing other things is not entirely supported. 
If you want to use the Blender scenes outside of PKX-IconGen, you can still save to a .blend file. For more advanced scenarios, you can modify the template located in the Python folder.
