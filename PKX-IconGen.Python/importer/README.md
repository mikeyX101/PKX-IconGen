# Blender SysDolphin Addon
A Blender addon for importing gamecube .dat models into Blender. This addon is currently developed predominantly for `Pokemon Colosseum` and `Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness` but may have some compatibility with other games that use the format (based on the sysdolphin library) such as `Super Smash Bros. Melee`, `Kirby Air ride` and `Killer7`.
Original implementation provided by Made. 

# How to use
Compress the the contents of this repository into a .zip file and then add that .zip file as an addon in Blender. This addon is targeted at Blender versions 2.8.0 and above, older versions may not work as intended. When the addon is enabled, navigate to File > Import > Gamecube model (.dat) and select your .dat model.
